Prompt
~~~~~~

Suppose we discover a bug with our algorithm and investors for two deals had incorrect
allocations. This means that some of the investors ended up investing more than they were allowed to
while others invested less than they were allowed to. One of deals happened two years ago and the
other one happened two weeks ago. Please describe, in detail, how would you go about correcting this
issue and how would you communicate this to the affected customers.

Response
~~~~~~~~

First, I'd greatly apologize for the horrible mistake and explain what caused the bug and announce a solution would
be out immediately. I think the best way to correct this issue would be to use the year in which the deal happened and
use the customer's average investment amount from that year, prorate using the amount they were going to allocate,
and financially compensate for the difference. The same would be the customer from two weeks ago, but instead they'd be
using the current year's model for financial compensation which would be less than the customer from two years ago. I
would also add more testing for the solution to make sure this issue never happens again.
