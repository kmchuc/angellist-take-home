Prompt
~~~~~~

An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

In the beginning, I myself had issues understanding how the proration calculation was conducted. The best way for me
to understand it was by comparing it to a real life scenario. For example, lets say it's your friend's birthday, you
and your friends want to split the cost of a birthday cake. The cake costs $50 and there's 5 of you splitting
the cost. Each person has a different amount of money they're willing to contribute. 3 people are willing to pay $20
and 2 people are willing to pay $10, the total contribution would $70 which is way more than the cost of the cake. So we
have to prorate everyone's amount using the rate of their contribution in order for the total to be $50, no more no less.
The same could be seen in this case where a startup is asking for a certain amount (allocation amount) but since there
are so many investors willing to invest in the company, to keep things fair we must prorate everyone's contribution
amount to make sure the total will not be greater than the allocation amount.

I think if the number of investors were limited for a startup, this would allow more of an opportunity for investors
to contribute closer to the amount they requested.
